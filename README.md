Titus Andronicus--Tragedies-Classifier--36R.rar contains a video file.
 
All webm files are also video files from actual experimentation (though with some adjustments for reasons of space, <25 MB)

For instance, ¨"Fan example with 2 rules and 2 inputs.webm" is a video file. 

Other webm(-video) files are:
Edward II--Validation Stage--Histories, 
A Measure For Measure --Comedies--Testing Stage, 
Testing Three Plays in the Primary Experimentation, 
Comparison of rules between Primary and Core Experimentation.

GENERAL NOTE

Various files are uploaded. Some of them contain files that present the statistical data (e.g. the indices of cosine similarity
of the plays) of the experimentation, some others the Matlab scripts, whereas there are also documents which contain 
the printout of the Ant Software regarding the measurement of the counts (hits) of the semantic sets of the 100 words 
(in core experimentation) and the words' frequencies' themselves. In addition, there are some explanatory videos that 
display issues of the fuzzification and defuzzification process and the way the results-are produced during the experimentation
in the so-called Validation-Stage 2 or Testing Stage (with non-sole-authored and non-well-attributed Shakespearean plays).

SPECIFIC NOTE
The file that contains the ‘data and statistics of the core experimentation.xslx’ in its first sheet has the counts of
the inputs-sets of the 27 well-attributed Shakespearean plays, thus the counts of four semantic sets and one of a total set
(of the four semantic sets). In the second sheet, the known plays can be viewed as counts of six semantic sets, since Set Three
is composed of three other subsets (S3=S3+S5+S6), which were Set Three, Five and Six in primary experimentation. In a few (six) 
cases in the experimentation with the ‘Ant’ Software when counting the four sets of the 27 known plays as six sets (with the three
subsets) in comparison with the four sets-based measurements there is a slight difference (0.1) for the count of Set Three and 
perhaps the count of the total set. This is generally a minor problem and it does not seem to affect dramatically the formation 
of the edges of classes. In general, effort was put to adopt the second measurements (of the six sets for more precision) for the 
modelling of the known plays apart from cases where it could be possible to include it in a trapezoidal class. (For instance, in 
Henry IV, Part II the two measurements provide for Set Three the data point of 1.7 and 1.8 and since there is already a count of 
another play for Set Three that is 1.8. in that case, the measurement of 1.7 was preferred because it contributes to the 
formation of a duplet and covers the uncertainty from every aspect). The plays in the validation and testing stage were measured
and mapped based on the counts of the four sets since only one plays’ counts (Timon of Athens) differed when measured as 
four sets and as four sets with the counts of the third set being composed of the counts of other three subsets. 
This difference with the sets counts is due to the fact that at the first level (graphical output with layers) there is 
a rounding at the first digit. Sometimes, the rounding of the four sets as four and six sets (Set three of three subsets) 
differs influencing also the counts of the total set.
